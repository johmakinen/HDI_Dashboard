# HDI_Dashboard
An interactive Streamlit dashboard on Human Development Index, and its components.   
The objective is to learn how to create a dashboard and deploy it with Streamlit.   
We are also using a new folder structure for this project to see if we like it and thus apply it in future projects.   
   
The dashboard can be found at &rarr; [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/johmakinen/hdi_dashboard/main/dashboard.py)
